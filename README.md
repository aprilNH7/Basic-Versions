# Overview of Basic Projects Before Enhancements

# 1. Android Application – CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming

# Overview
This project was developed as part of the CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The primary objective was to build a functional Android application that demonstrated the core concepts of mobile development using Android Studio and Java. The basic version focused on:

User Interface (UI): A simple UI layout to allow basic interactions.
Event Handling: Functional buttons and text fields for user interaction.
Data Storage: Basic internal storage using shared preferences.
Key Features
Basic UI: Included buttons, text fields, and basic layouts.
User Input Handling: Users could input and retrieve data within the session.
Simple Data Storage: Data persisted locally using shared preferences.
Limitations Before Enhancement
No modern UI/UX design elements.
No support for cloud-based data storage.
Lacked features such as user authentication and data synchronization.

# 2. 3D Pyramid – CS-330: Graphics and Visualization

# Overview
This artifact, 3DTriangleOpenGL, was created during the CS-330: Graphics and Visualization course. It was built using C++ and OpenGL to introduce students to 3D graphics programming. The focus of the project was on rendering a simple 3D pyramid and learning about:

Shaders: Basic vertex and fragment shaders.
Buffers: Understanding and managing vertex and index buffers (VBO/EBO).
3D Transformations: Implementing basic transformations like rotation and scaling.
Key Features
Rendering a 3D Pyramid: Visualizing a simple pyramid in a 3D environment.
Basic Shaders: Used simple vertex and fragment shaders to render objects.
Manual Buffer Management: Managed VBOs and EBOs directly.
Limitations Before Enhancement
No modular structure: All logic was contained within a single code block.
Limited error handling: Shader compilation errors weren’t efficiently captured.
No support for multiple objects: Only one pyramid could be rendered at a time.

# 3. Travlr Getaways Website – CS-340: Database Design

# Overview
This project, Travlr Getaways, was initially developed for the CS-340: Database Design course. The purpose of the website was to provide a basic travel booking platform where users could search for and purchase trips. The project used MongoDB as the backend to manage trip data.

Key Features
Trip Search Functionality: Users could search for available trips.
Booking System: Basic form submission to book trips.
MongoDB Integration: Stored trip data in a NoSQL database.
Limitations Before Enhancement
No user authentication: Any user could access the system without credentials.
Basic form submission: No advanced error handling for invalid inputs.
No optimization: The database had no indexing, impacting performance.
Conclusion
These projects represent the foundation for my enhancement plan, with improvements focusing on modern UI/UX design, better modularity and scalability, and enhanced security and data management. The enhanced versions will demonstrate significant improvements in both functionality and efficiency, aligning them with industry standards and best practices.
